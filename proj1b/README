Orderqueue class: implements my queue which is a doubly linked list of 
OrderNode structs, relies on the provided Order class that implements the 
Order struct

instance variables: start pointer to the first OrderNode in the list, tail 
pointer to the end of the list

Nozama class: uses the provided Parser class to read the input file, keeps 
track of time with a function that increments time and performs the necessary 
actions (moving Orders around and editing their information within the fetcher
 and packers), the increment_time function will be called
repeatedly in a while loop in the simulate function that acts as the main loop
 for simulating Nozama

instance variables: int clock, Queue inputOrders, Queue [] fetchers, Queue[] 
packers, constructor takes in a number of packers, an input filename, and an 
algorithim type

main.cpp: main function for simulation, only uses public Nozama functions
calls simulate, uses sscanf to parse number of packers from command line

changes to Order.h: added data member int total_time
