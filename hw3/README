Homework 3, Comp 15: Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
Annamira O'Toole 9/27/2016
Purpose of program: to create a reverse polish notation calculator similar to the built in Unix dc calculator
Files provided:
      DoubleStack.h: declares a class called DoubleStack, which implements a doubly linked list
      last-in-first-out style stack 
      DoubleStack.cpp: implements both the public and private functions of DoubleStack
      RPNCalc.h: declares a class called RPNCalc, which creates a reverse polish notation calculator
      that uses DoubleStack to implement its list of input values 
      RPNCalc.cpp: implements both the public and private functions of RPNCalc
How to compile: ????

I used doubly linked lists to implement the last-in-first-out style RPN calculator
Doubly linked lists are more easily expanded in size than arrays and each element in
the list has access to the element before, an important feature for the functionality of 
the RPNCalc class, since each command (+ - * /) requires the last two inputted values
as opposed to only the tail end of the stack
