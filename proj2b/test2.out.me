smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:377: To this problem he did commit.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:382: Perhaps, in this trench, the water would stop!
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:385: To give them this instruction.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:386: By this site he was again inspired
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:391: Into this we all must pitch
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:394: A solution to this we must seek.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:406: But this wont stop the waters force.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:413: A great man must save this town!

smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:528: He thought, for a moment, about this attack.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:544: And this sent the great man into thought.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:549: He began to feel that this was bizarre,
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:550: And then this pattern, he began to trace.
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:564: He wondered how this could go unknown
smallG/www.gutenberg.lib.md.us/1/3/0/7/13075/13075.txt:575: No doubt this was the source of the leak.
