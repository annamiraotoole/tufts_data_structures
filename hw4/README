The title of the homework and the authorâ€™s name:

HW4 Alphabetizer, Annamira O'Toole

The purpose of the program:

To alphabetize strings input via a file, or the command line, can also
alphabetize in reverse order

The files that you provided and a short description of what
each file is and its purpose:

BSTTesting.cpp used for unit testing StringBST class
AlphaTesting.cpp used for unit testing Alphabetizer class
StringBST.h header file for binary search tree of strings
StringBST.cpp implementation of functions declared in StringBST.h
Alphabetizer.h header file for alphabetizer class used by client
Alphabetizer.cpp implementation of functions declared in Alphabetizer.h
main.cpp a client of Alphabetizer.h, interacts with command line (contains
main function)

How to compile and run your program:

for interactive mode: ./alphabetizer 
for automated mode: ./alphabetizer <order> <filename>

An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used:

data structures: binary search tree implemented by StringBST
algorithims: recursive tree traversals

StringBST::print function: in-order traversal
StringBST::remove function: post-order traversal + calls itself when it
shuffles tree (if node to be removed has two children)
StringBST::add function: uses private getNode() to find spot to add string
with pre-order traversal
StringBST::contains function: pre-order traversal 

Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts
of your classes and the program as a whole:

Created some simple instances of StringBST, used the function to be tested,
and then printed out the resultant tree
